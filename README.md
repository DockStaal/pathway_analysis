The purpose of this GitHub repository is to serve as a reference for the included report about a Bayesian-based method for pathway analysis. 
The code made use of the two following sources. 
First, the probabilistic matrix factorization code has been taken from [this](https://docs.pymc.io/en/v3/pymc-examples/examples/case_studies/probabilistic_matrix_factorization.html) website. 
Second, the data used in the results + the code to extract specific data comes from [this](https://github.com/statisticalbiotechnology/cb2030) repository.
